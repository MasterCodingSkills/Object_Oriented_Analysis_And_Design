----------------Problem in Initial Design------------------

1 : Except price every property of Guitar is in String format,
	if user provide his search inputs in LowerCase,UpperCase or
	in mix format than searching of Guitar not works.
		-> Even though we can eliminate this by caseInsensitve 
		search but that increases burden of comparing Strings.
		
Solution Applied :
	For type safety we should apply Enum instead of String checks.
	
	
2 : Sending a Guitar object in search method is unnecessary because
	client is never sending all properties.
	
Solution Applied : 
	Encapsulate Guitar Specifications that client is sending in search.
